# Microscope Web App

##What is Microscope?

Humanity spreads to the stars and forges a galactic civilization…

Fledgling nations arise from the ruins of the empire…

An ancient line of dragon-kings dies out as magic fades from the realm…

These are all examples of Microscope games. Want to explore an epic history of
your own creation, hundreds or thousands of years long, all in an afternoon?
That's Microscope.

You won't play the game in chronological order. You can defy the limits of time
and space, jumping backward or forward to explore the parts of the history that
interest you. Want to leap a thousand years into the future and see how an
institution shaped society? Want to jump back to the childhood of the king you
just saw assassinated and find out what made him such a hated ruler? That’s
normal in Microscope.

You have vast power to create... and to destroy. Build beautiful, tranquil
jewels of civilization and then consume them with nuclear fire. Zoom out to
watch the majestic tide of history wash across empires, then zoom in and explore
the lives of the people who endured it.

Mock chronological order.   
Defy time and space.    
Build worlds and destroythem.

A role-playing game for two to four players. No GM. No prep. Microscope was
playtested for two years by over 150 awesome gamers.

##Who are you, and why did you make this web app?
 
This web playable version of Microscope was made by David Lorant and Ben Fraser.
We made it becase we used to love playing it with friends in college, but after everyone
graduated and moved away, it became very difficult to get together and play.
We wanted to create a way to play together online, and this is the results.
